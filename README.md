# hello-world

Start 2 code

45 yr. old newbie in coding. Should have started 20 yrs. ago but i guess it's never to late 2 start. Trying to get ASAP into the basics of computer science and coding. 
Interests in Python to start with and we will see from there where to go. Taking courses on my own pace due to full-time dayjob and 2 kids 2 raise.
